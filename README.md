**MusincSyncServer**

MusincServer backend for Musinc clients.

The purpose of this application is to manage various things that
may be of prominent issue in the community of people who use online
music streaming services.

For those who are using the application's key feature, Sessions, 
upon their request a playlist can be created containing the songs 
that are being played by the host user.

A group (or Session) can be created from the companion iOS 
application, which contains a host user and up to 50 other client
users. In doing this, any music which is played by the host user
will be synced live on the Spotify accounts of all other 
participants.

A main feature that will be implemented soon is one that is able to
duplicate playlists across various streaming services such as 
Spotify, Deezer, TIDAL, SoundCloud and others. This will help 
lessen the turmoil that comes packaged with switching your main 
streaming service by simply logging into Musinc's app or website 
and connecting two of your desired streaming service accounts and 
allowing Musinc to do the heavy lifting for you.

Playlists can also be more easily shared using Musinc, as a playlist
can be sent via a Musinc link which can then be opened by any user
with a Musinc account (either on the app or the website) and then
transferred from the original streaming service that it was on to 
whatever streaming service the receiving user prefers.
